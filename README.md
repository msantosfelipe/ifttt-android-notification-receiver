Project made to centralize notification propagation workflow

![Service draw](<draw.png>)

- Using an automation app, I receive the notifications and send it to this API
This is made using toll like IFTTT or Macrodroid

- The service filters the notifications of interest and re-send it via email, SMS or whatsapp

- The notification is stored in a database for future analysis
